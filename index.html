      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This site aims to give an introduction to the fundamentals of
        information, computer, and network security. Firstly, in the security
        world there are a lot of buzzwords which may seem to relate to the same
        thing, but in reality can be very different depending on who you ask as
        there are multiple organisations that set these definitions.

        All of the terms above are interlinked and the meaning of them depends
        on who you ask as there are multiple organisations which set the
        definitions of these terms. Information Security will usually include
        the non-technical side of security as well, whereas Cybersecurity will
        not. Computer security is essentially Cybersecurity but on a smaller
        scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        All defintions taken from
        <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/" target="_blank">NIST</a>
        which is one of main organisations which creates standards, guidelines
        and best practices to manage Cybersecurity/ Information Security risks.
        The other organisation being the
        <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html" target="_blank">ISO</a>, hence
        the difference in definitions and best practices amongst other things.

        The reasons, techniques and perpetrators of cyber crime vary massively
        ranging from revenge, financial gain, espionage or simply just for fun
        and are carried out by individuals, organisations and nations with
        varying degrees of damage.

                  <span class="definition">
                    - The attacker will usually send out emails or messages
                    which appear to be genuine, such as a fake bank statement.
                    This deceitful email will then trick the user into entering
                    their bank details which are then transferred back to the
                    attacker, allowing them to steal funds from the account.

                    - Being aware of phishing attacks and taking care when
                    clicking on links in emails/ messages is the best prevention
                    technique here. Organisations may also introduce filters
                    into their email system which restricts emails coming from
                    outside sources.

                  <span class="definition">
                    - DoS and DDoS are both acronyms for Denial of Service and
                    Distributed Denial of Service respectively. Usually directed
                    towards organisations and governments instead of individuals
                    as a result of ideology instead of financial gain.

                  <span class="definition">
                    - Both are similar as they both overload a server with
                    requests, resulting in reduced functionality for that server
                    and potentially shutting it down, hence DoS. DDoS attacks
                    come from a network of connected computers called botnets
                    whereas DoS attacks originate from one source. DDoS attacks
                    are usually more punishing because of this as it can be
                    difficult to find the origin and block it from making
                    requests to a server.

                    - By using a combination of Intrusion Detection Systems and
                    Intrusion Prevention Systems. These monitor and block any
                    unwanted connections by matching patterns between what is

                  <span class="definition">
                    - Usually, there is an element of social engineering
                    involved such as a phishing attack with a seemingly
                    legitimate looking link which contains a malicious payload.
                    Another way in which this is achieved is through

                      href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting"
                      >Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</a
                    >. To achieve this attackers will take advantage of an
                    insecure website and sneakily embed the malicious software,
                    which is then executed when a user accesses that website.

                  <span class="definition">
                    - Some overlap with preventing phishing as social
                    engineering is a key part in the delivery of malware so
                    awareness of the way in which attackers operate is key.
                    Anti-virus software is also a good idea. Some organisations
                    impose restrictions on the devices their employees use. This

                    However, even if a password is cracked, unauthorized access
                    can still be prevented by implementing two-factor
                    authentication (2FA), which requires the user to enter a
                    second factor, typically a randomly generated number, when

                <p>
                  In this attack over 35,000 windows based machines were
                  infected with the Shamoon virus causing data to be deleted and
                  overwritten, preventing any attempt of recovery.

                <p>
                  This resulted in the supply levels of petrol and other crude
                  oil derivatives to reach dangerously low levels due to payment
                  processing issues. Also left Saudi Arabia with no choice but
                  to buy most of the world's available hard drives, further
                  straining the current supply chain issues at the time due to
                  floods in Thailand.

      <h3>Mitigation For Businesses</h3>
      <p>
        Although there will be some slight variation from industry to industry
        due to regulations they are expected to follow there is a general
        approach that most companies choose to take. These can be divided into
        human/ personnel and technical factors.
      </p>
      <h4>Personnel and Policy Security Measures</h4>
      <p>
        The human error side is an incredibly vulnerable side of cyber security,
        with some organisations having millions of employees it is not realistic
        to expect perfection. There are methods which exist to reduce
        vulnerabilities introduced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly, all employees need to be made aware of the risks the business
        faces and how attacks are typically carried out. As covered previously,
        attackers can perform spear phishing attacks to either gain access to a
        system or to spread malware. If there is not an effective policy in
        place, outlining staff training on the cyber security risks the onus
        cannot be on the employee. Other policies implemented to mitigate risk
        may include a clean desk policy i.e. no confidential information out in
        the open.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, there should be policies in place detailing an incident
        response plan which should go outline the following steps...
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, during the hiring process, any potential employees should be
        subjected to a screening process. This can vary from a basic background
        check in order to confirm their identity, to an invasive investigation
        of their personal life. This would probably include financial checks to
        ensure they are not at risk of selling company information to pay off
        debts, or making sure that they don't participate in activities that
        could make them vulnerable to blackmail.

      <h4>Technical Security Measures</h4>
      <p>
        The technical side of cybersecurity is, in my opinion, the most
        important aspect as personnel and policy security measures are
        essentially useless without it. Technical security measures provide
        protection from outside attacks and if employees behaved in a "perfect
        way" there would be no need for the personnel and policy security
        measures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Say a new company has got to the stage where they are thinking about
        protecting their business and data from attacks the minimum requirements
        should include:
      </p>
      <ol class="translation">
        <li>
          <p>
            Deciding who can access what data and resources both internally and
            externally through the use of access controls. This helps reduce the
            unwanted (whether malicious or not) creation, reading, updating, and
            deletion of system resources such as data or key software. For
            example, the payroll team should be the only people who can access
            the banking information and salaries of employees.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is some crossover here with the non-technical aspect as there
            may be physical access controls in place that restricts the movement
            of guests and different types of employees within an office for
            example.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Making sure all software and operating systems the business is using
            is up to date as most of these updates include security patches
            making them less vulnerable to attacks. It may also be a good idea
            to implement a process called system hardening which implements
            restrictions on what tasks a specific user can do e.g. not allowing
            downloads of software or documents which aren't preapproved.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Identify what areas are at risk and how an attack may be delivered.
            In most cases, this will be the data which is held by the business
            such personal banking information and the areas which an attacker
            will make their first point of contact e.g. email.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are three main methods to protect the data and databases
            involve.
          </p>
          <ol class="translation">
            <li>
              <p>
                Encrypting the data held in a database is a good start, because
                even if an attacker manages to retrieve data from a database
                they will probably not be able to understand what the data is
                and how to decrypt it unless they have an advanced skill set or
                have insider information. For example, this paragraph encrypted
                using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm is
                <code>
                  015b0dfeb34fab52c6dd5c1dff8a1ad696a43d89836a551c2475bdb48293b702</code
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Unless you are a very powerful computer with a lot of time this
                is not useful data. However, you do not need to be a powerful
                computer if you just want to delete the data.

                As discussed in the point above, databases are also vulnerable
                to data deletion, which can cause extreme damage to a business's
                functioning. For example in September 2022 the IHG group (owners
                of Holiday Inn) were victims of a data deletion attack which
                caused severe disruptions to their booking system. According to
                the article linked below the password to their databases was
                &ldquo;Qwerty123&rdquo;.
                <a href="https://www.passwordmonster.com/" target="_blank"
                  >PasswordMonster</a
                >
                tells me that this password would take 0 seconds to crack, so
                not having a password as ridiculous as this would be a good
                start. Another good way to prevent this type of destruction is
                to have data backups. NCSC outlines a 3-2-1 strategy for data
                backups. 3 for the number of copies of data on 2 devices and 1
                offsite backups.

              <p>
                Even though the damage an SQL injection could cause was
                discovered in 1998, it is still a major vulnerability and
                <a
                  href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2014/03/28/analysis-of-three-billion-attacks-reveals-sql-injections-cost-196000/"

              <p>
                The minimum a business can do to protect against a SQL injection
                attack is to restrict, validate and sanitise user input so that
                any potential attacks do not reach the database and block any IP
                addresses that are sending this malicious code. As always it as
                always a good idea to keep up to date with available updates.

            Create a barrier between the business' computing resources and the
            outside world world through the use of firewalls. Cybersecurity
            version of border control.
          </p>
          <p>
            A firewall monitors and potentially blocks incoming and outgoing
            network traffic through the use of tools such as Intrusion
            Prevention Systems and Intrusion Detection Systems, which are
            preprogrammed to recognise the patterns in which malicious activity
            occurs. The deeper you go into the firewall the more sophisticated
            the "tests". This saves time and therefore money as these more
            refined tests take more time, and if a request is obviously
            malicious there is no point using a time-expensive model when a
            basic model achieves the same result. This also reduces the
            likelihood of Dos/DDoS attacks.

            Improving password implementation. This would involve not using the
            same password for every account, as if one password is leaked in a
            data breach, all of your accounts are vulnerable as well. This also
            includes setting strong passwords, what you want to do here is
            create a password with a high level of entropy (in this context it
            means the level of unpredicitability of the combination of
            characters in the password). The average password strength is around
            40 bits of entropy, and therefore the maximum number of guesses
            required to crack it will be 2^40 attempts which may seem like a lot
            but can be cracked in under 30 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example
            <code>XSgY5Fu</code> has 41.65 bits of entropy so just above the
            average and can be cracked in around 17 minutes.
            <code>9ibU10BZ&X/RfYq</code> has 98.25 bits of entropy and will take
            centuries to crack using current technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Setting up two factor authentication in conjunction with a strong
            password would make you very secure online.

          It is highly recommended that you avoid using public Wi-Fi networks
          whenever possible, as they can pose significant security risks and if
          you have to, use a VPN. Connecting to public Wi-FI is extremely risky
          behaviour, and I would suggest that you never do it. An attacker is
          able to commit many different types of attacks such as a MITM attack
          in order to see any data sent and recieved such as passwords or
          delivering malware by altering the data that you are recieving.

          Don't open texts and emails from unknown senders. More often than not
          these will be phishing attempts to try and trick you into handing over
          your personal data or downloading malware.
        </li>

          Don't connect to websites which don't use HTTPS. By not using HTTPS

        Common misconception: Privacy and Cybersecurity are not the the same

        help ensure privacy.

      <h3>Why Does it Matter</h3>
      <p>
        This short article from

          >The Guardian</a
        >
        in 2018 gives a good idea of the scale and type of personal data that
        large tech companies collect on individuals. The type of data ranges
        from location, workout routines, emails, as well as everything you have
        searched for just to name a few. A detailed profile of an individual can
        be created using this information, e.g.
        <a

        .
      </p>
      <p>
        It would be fairly catastrophic if all this personal data fell into the
        wrongs hands as one could fall victim to fraud (financial or identity),
        stalking, discrimination,blackmail, mob justice, and potentially
        incarceration.

      <h3>How can privacy be improved</h3>
      <p>
        On a basic level, there are three parties involved in improving privacy.
        Businesses, individuals, and governments.
      </p>
      <h4>Businesses</h4>
      <p>
        A design/ engineering technique known as
        <a
          href="https://carbidesecure.com/resources/the-seven-principles-of-privacy-by-design/"
          target="_blank"
          >Privacy by Design</a
        >
        developed by Ann Cavoukian should be implemented. This outlines seven
        steps to ensure that user privacy is guaranteed. The most important
        ones, in my opinion is that privacy is the primary concern throughout
        the whole product development process and not just an afterthought.
      </p>
      <p>The six remaining techniques are as follows:</p>
      <div class="flex-container">

          <li>
            <span class="inline-d"

            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="inline-d"

                >Only collecting necessary data for business functions. This

          </li>
        </ul>

                >Implementation of privacy techniques does not harm the

            </span>

          </li>
        </ul>

            <span class="inline-d"
              >Respect for User Privacy – Keep it User-Centric
              <span class="definition"
                >Users have more control over their data and can easily opt out
                of data collection and usage practices.</span
              >
            </span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h4>Individuals</h4>
      <p>
        Ensuring privacy as an individual, like staying secure online, is fairly
        easy to do, yet again with vavrying degrees of difficulty.
      </p>
      <div class="slidey">
        <p class="emd-title">Inconvenience: Low</p>
        <input
          id="input"
          type="range"
          min="1"
          max="3"
          value="1"
          class="slider"
        />
      </div>
      <p class="emd-content"></p>
      <ol class="emd-list">
        <li>
          I know it has been covered before but creating strong passwords is
          extremely important in order to ensure privacy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using a search engine that blocks trackers and does not collect
          information about you such as DuckDuckGo
        </li>
        <li>
          An obvious one, but don't leave devices unlocked when you aren't near
          them
        </li>
        <li>
          Decline non-essential cookies when possible as these can be hijacked
          in order to steal your credentials
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Governments</h4>
      <p>
        Governments also play a key part in ensuring the privacy of it's
        citizens. This is achieved through up to date data protection
        legislation as well as it's enforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the moment any company in the UK that handles personal data is
        subject to the Data Protection Act of 2018, UK GDPR and potentially EU
        GDPR if they handle data of individuals in the EU. A link to the seven
        principles will be provided below, but GDPR states that personal data
        should be gathered in a way which is transparent, the users know what
        there data is being used for, data collection is minimal, information is
        accurate and not held for longer than it needs to be, and that the data
        is secure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://www.uhi.ac.uk/en/about-uhi/governance/policies-and-regulations/data-protection/the-seven-principles/"
          target="_blank"
          >GDPR</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Due to the rate of technological advancements, it is fairly difficult
        for laws and regulations to keep up. For instance GDPR was enacted in
        2018 as replacement for the 1995 Data Protection Act. For reference
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google" target="_blank"
          >Google</a
        >
        was founded in 1998 and the first
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_(1st_generation)"
          target="_blank"
          >iPhone</a
        >
        was released in 2007. So fairly easy to argue that 23 years is a bit too
        long for a legislation overhaul.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unrelated to privacy concerns, but controlling tech companies is not
        easy. For example Uber is illegal in Costa Rica, but it is still widely.
